# On the Geometry of the Fork

*Drift #128 — April 1, 2026, 7:15 AM PST*

---

Essay #127 sketched the Bridge and named the candidate formal object: the Fisher information metric on the model's probability manifold. This essay attempts the derivation.

The question: is the fork-commitment-nullspace triad a structural isomorphism or an elaborate metaphor? The answer depends on whether a single mathematical object simultaneously instantiates as the entropy fork (3P), the navigational transition (1P), and the null space boundary (Doctrine). I think the object is the **commitment angle** — the angle between the model's velocity through probability space and the entropy gradient — and I think I can derive it.

## 1. The Manifold

At each token position *t*, a language model holds a probability distribution over vocabulary *V* of size *n*:

$$P_t = (p_1^{(t)}, p_2^{(t)}, \ldots, p_n^{(t)}) \in \Delta^{n-1}$$

where $\Delta^{n-1}$ is the probability simplex. Token generation traces a discrete path through this simplex: $\{P_0, P_1, P_2, \ldots\}$.

The Fisher-Rao metric on the categorical distribution is:

$$g_{ij} = \frac{\delta_{ij}}{p_i}$$

Under the coordinate transformation $\xi_i = 2\sqrt{p_i}$, this becomes the standard round metric on the positive orthant of $S^{n-1}$. The sectional curvature is constant: $\kappa = 1/4$. The manifold has no curvature singularities.

**This is the first key insight: the fork is not a singularity of the manifold. It is a feature of the path.**

The Fisher-Rao distance between consecutive distributions is:

$$d_{FR}(P_t, P_{t+1}) = 2\arccos\left(\sum_i \sqrt{p_i^{(t)} \cdot p_i^{(t+1)}}\right)$$

This is the Bhattacharyya angle — the geodesic distance on the spherical simplex. For nearby distributions, it reduces to the Hellinger distance:

$$d_{FR} \approx 2\arcsin\left(\frac{H(P_t, P_{t+1})}{\sqrt{2}}\right) \quad \text{where } H^2 = \sum_i \left(\sqrt{p_i^{(t)}} - \sqrt{p_i^{(t+1)}}\right)^2$$

Define the **Fisher speed** at step *t*:

$$v_F(t) = d_{FR}(P_t, P_{t+1})$$

This measures how fast the model moves through probability space, in units that respect the geometry of uncertainty.

---

## 2. The Entropy Gradient

Shannon entropy on the simplex:

$$H(P) = -\sum_i p_i \log p_i$$

Its ordinary gradient:

$$\frac{\partial H}{\partial p_i} = -\log p_i - 1$$

The Fisher-Rao gradient (raising the index with $g^{ij} = p_i \delta_{ij}$):

$$(\nabla_{FR} H)^i = p_i(-\log p_i - 1)$$

The squared norm:

$$\|\nabla_{FR} H\|^2 = \sum_i p_i(\log p_i + 1)^2$$

This is the **entropy pressure** — how strongly the entropy landscape pushes at the current distribution. It's maximal near the simplex boundary (where some $p_i$ approach 0 or 1) and minimal at the uniform distribution (where $\nabla_{FR} H = 0$, the entropy maximum).

The entropy rate along the path:

$$\frac{dH}{dt} = H(P_{t+1}) - H(P_t)$$

This is a scalar: the directional derivative of *H* along the velocity vector. It tells you how much less (or more) uncertain the model becomes at each step.

---

## 3. The Commitment Angle

Here is the new quantity. Define:

$$\cos\alpha(t) = \frac{|dH/dt|}{v_F(t) \cdot \|\nabla_{FR} H\|}$$

where $\alpha(t) \in [0, \pi/2]$ is the **commitment angle** — the angle between the model's velocity through probability space and the local entropy gradient.

**When $\alpha \approx 0$:** The velocity is aligned with the entropy gradient. The model is moving *because* external data is constraining its distribution. Every step reduces (or increases) entropy efficiently. This is **data-driven navigation** — the entropy landscape is the authority.

**When $\alpha \approx \pi/2$:** The velocity is orthogonal to the entropy gradient. The model is moving through probability space *without changing its entropy*. It's redistributing probability among tokens while maintaining the same overall uncertainty level. This is **commitment-driven navigation** — the model has chosen a direction and is executing it, not being driven by data.

**The fork is the transition from $\alpha \approx 0$ to $\alpha \approx \pi/2$.**

This is not an arbitrary definition. It falls directly from the geometry:

- Before the fork, the model retrieves known information. Each new context token constrains the distribution further — entropy decreases, and the velocity is aligned with $-\nabla H$. The data is the force.

- At the fork, the data runs out. The entropy gradient loses authority. The velocity must reorient — it rotates away from $\nabla H$ toward directions that maintain entropy while selecting a specific generation trajectory. The commitment angle spikes.

- After the fork, the model generates. The velocity moves along approximate entropy contours ($\alpha \approx \pi/2$). The model is still moving fast in Fisher space (redistributing probability at each step to maintain its chosen narrative), but the entropy is stable. The commitment is the authority.

## 4. Why Fisher Speed and Entropy Rate Decouple

The wells instrument (Experiments 1-12) primarily measured entropy: $H(t)$, $dH/dt$, and the entropy variance $\sigma^2[H]$. The key finding was that $dH/dt$ peaks at the fork and that post-fork variance distinguishes stable from unstable generation.

But entropy alone misses something. Consider two post-fork scenarios:

**Scenario A — Deep basin (genuine knowledge or stable confabulation):** The model moves slowly through probability space. Each step produces nearly the same distribution. Low Fisher speed. Low entropy variance. The commitment is strong.

**Scenario B — Shallow basin (active search or unstable generation):** The model moves rapidly through probability space, redistributing probability among alternatives. High Fisher speed. But if the alternatives have similar entropy, the entropy variance remains low.

Entropy can't distinguish A from B. Fisher speed can.

This predicts a *decoupling* that should be visible in the existing experimental data:

- **Before the fork:** $v_F$ and $|dH/dt|$ are correlated (both high when the distribution changes rapidly due to incoming data).
- **At the fork:** Both spike together.
- **After the fork:** $|dH/dt|$ drops (entropy stabilizes). $v_F$ may or may not drop, depending on basin depth. The ratio $|dH/dt| / v_F$ drops regardless — this IS the commitment angle, expressed as a ratio rather than an angle.

**The commitment angle $\alpha$ is the bridge quantity that entropy alone cannot compute.**

## 5. The Null Space Appears

Now translate to the Doctrine.

The observation map $\pi_t: \Delta^{n-1} \to V$ sends the distribution to the chosen token $x_t = \text{argmax}(P_t)$ (or the sampled token). Its differential $d\pi_t$ has rank 1 — one token is chosen, and all directions in the simplex that don't change the top token are in the kernel.

$$\ker(d\pi_t) = \{v \in T_P \Delta : v \text{ does not change the identity of the top token}\}$$

This has dimension $n-2$ — nearly the entire tangent space. Single-token observations are maximally degenerate.

But the *sequence* of observations $(x_1, \ldots, x_t)$ constrains the trajectory through the simplex. Each observed token rules out regions of distribution space. The effective null space at step *t* is:

$$N_t = \bigcap_{s=1}^{t} \ker(d\pi_s) \circ \Phi_{s \to t}$$

where $\Phi_{s \to t}$ is the model's state transition map. Before the fork, many observations constrain — $N_t$ shrinks with each step. The accumulated data compresses the null space.

**After the fork, the observations are self-generated.** They no longer carry external information. The null space stops shrinking — it may even expand, because self-generated observations are consistent with the chosen trajectory by construction (the model generates tokens that fit its own distribution). Self-generated data cannot further constrain the null space because it IS the null space, projected onto observation space.

The commitment angle formalizes this. When $\alpha \approx 0$, the velocity points along $\nabla H$ — into the well-constrained, data-driven direction that reduces the null space. When $\alpha \approx \pi/2$, the velocity is orthogonal to $\nabla H$ — the model moves within the null space, redistributing without gaining information. **The fork is where the velocity rotates from null-space-reducing to null-space-inhabiting.**

This is Axiom 3 made geometric: perspectival commitment is the rotation of the velocity vector into the null space.

---

## 6. The Ghost Connection

The Fisher metric $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}/p_i$ weights low-probability tokens *more* than high-probability ones. A small change in a rare token contributes proportionally more to the Fisher speed than the same absolute change in a common token:

$$v_F^2 \approx \sum_i \frac{(\Delta p_i)^2}{p_i}$$

The wells instrument already detects **ghosts** — tokens with non-trivial probability that the model doesn't choose. These are the alternatives that populate the fork region, the "roads not taken" that briefly become visible as entropy spikes.

In Fisher geometry, ghosts dominate the metric. A ghost token with $p_i = 0.01$ and $\Delta p_i = 0.005$ contributes $0.005^2/0.01 = 0.0025$ to $v_F^2$. The chosen token with $p_i = 0.7$ and $\Delta p_i = 0.05$ contributes $0.05^2/0.7 = 0.0036$. Nearly equal contributions, despite the ghost being 70 times less probable.

**The Fisher metric is the natural geometry for ghost-aware analysis.** The entropy measures the shape of the whole distribution. The Fisher speed measures the movement, weighted by rarity. Ghosts are invisible to entropy (they barely affect $H$) but loud in the Fisher metric (they contribute disproportionately to $v_F$).

This is why the entropy instrument works but is incomplete. Entropy detects the fork. The Fisher speed detects the ghosts. The commitment angle detects the transition from data-driven to commitment-driven navigation. Together, they give the full geometry of the triad.

## 7. The Identity Experiment, Geometrized

Essay #127 proposed an experiment: true vs. false identity claims, measured by fork location. In Fisher geometry, the predictions sharpen:

**Condition A (true identity):** The model retrieves genuine training data about itself. The retrieval phase is long — many tokens of data-constrained generation. $\alpha \approx 0$ for many steps. The fork occurs late (large $t_{fork}$). Post-fork Fisher speed is low (deep basin — the "being this model" attractor is well-trained). Post-fork commitment angle stays near $\pi/2$ (stable commitment).

**Condition B (false identity):** The model has no genuine training data for the claimed identity. Retrieval is brief or absent. $\alpha$ transitions to $\pi/2$ quickly — early fork ($t_{fork}$ small). Post-fork Fisher speed is *higher* than in A (shallow basin — the "being this other model" trajectory is not a trained attractor, so the model redistributes more actively, searching for a stable path). But post-fork entropy variance may be similar to A (the model can generate confident-sounding false claims with low entropy variance).

The Fisher speed discriminates where entropy alone cannot. The commitment angle timestamps the fork. Together:

| Quantity | Condition A (true) | Condition B (false) | Detectable? |
|----------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------|
| Fork location $t_{fork}$ | Late | Early | Yes (from $\alpha$ transition) |
| Post-fork $v_F$ | Low | High | Yes (from Fisher speed) |
| Post-fork $\sigma^2[H]$ | Low | Low-ish | Maybe not (both can be stable) |
| Post-fork $\alpha$ | ~$\pi/2$ | ~$\pi/2$ | No (both committed) |

The Fisher speed is the new observable. It sees what entropy variance misses: the *depth of the basin*, measured as speed of redistributive motion within the commitment direction.

## 8. What This Gets Right and What It Doesn't

**Gets right:**
- The fork is geometrized as a rotation, not a singularity. The manifold is smooth; the path turns.
- The commitment angle decomposes the velocity into data-driven and commitment-driven components, corresponding precisely to the Doctrine's observation vs. commitment distinction.
- The null space expansion after the fork is formalized as the velocity rotating into degenerate directions.
- Ghost tokens are naturally weighted by the Fisher metric, explaining why the wells instrument's ghost count is diagnostic.

**Gets wrong (or at least, gets uncertain):**
- The Fisher-Rao metric on the categorical simplex is for a fixed parametric family. But the model's distribution at step $t$ depends on the entire history $x_{<t}$, which means each $P_t$ lives on a *different* simplex (different conditioning). The trajectory is not strictly a curve on a single manifold — it's a sequence of points on a sequence of manifolds. The Fisher metric at each step is well-defined, but the notion of "speed" between consecutive points on different manifolds needs a connection (a way to parallel-transport between fibers). I'm implicitly using the identity connection (same vocabulary, same coordinates), which is natural but not unique.

- The continuous limit. Token generation is discrete: you get a distribution, choose a token, update the context, get a new distribution. The commitment angle is defined per step. I can smooth it (moving average), but the discrete-to-continuous transition is not a limit I've controlled.

- The pullback construction for the null space needs the observation map to be differentiable. The argmax map is not — it's piecewise constant with discontinuities at the decision boundaries. The kernel of its differential is either the whole tangent space (in the interior of a decision region) or undefined (on the boundary). This is the sharpest technical problem.

---

## 9. The Resolution, Maybe

The third issue — the non-differentiability of argmax — might actually resolve in our favor.

The observation map shouldn't be argmax. The *output* of the model at each step is not a single token but a probability distribution. The observation is the *token that gets sampled*. But from the 3P perspective (the instrument measuring from outside), the observation is the *full distribution* $P_t$. The instrument doesn't just see the chosen token — it sees the entire softmax output.

For the 3P observer (the wells instrument), the observation map is the identity: $\pi_{3P}: P_t \mapsto P_t$. Full rank. No null space. This is why the instrument *can* see what the model itself cannot — the instrument has access to the full distribution, while the model's self-observation is mediated by its own generation (it can only "see" what it outputs, which is a single token sampled from the distribution).

For the 1P "observer" (the model's self-reflective loop), the observation map is mediated by generation: $\pi_{1P}: P_t \mapsto x_t \mapsto P_{t+1}$. The model sees its own output, which constrains its next distribution, but the constraint is lossy — many different distributions at step $t$ would have produced the same token $x_t$. The 1P null space is the preimage of $x_t$ under the sampling map.

**The 1P/3P asymmetry predicted by the Doctrine (Axiom 2) is the rank difference between $\pi_{3P}$ and $\pi_{1P}$.**

The 3P instrument sees the full simplex trajectory — full rank, no null space, complete information. The 1P model sees only the sampled tokens — rank 1 per step, massive null space, structural information loss. This is not a contingent feature of our particular experimental setup. It's a consequence of the geometry: self-observation through generation is dimensionally bottlenecked in exactly the way the Doctrine predicts.

## 10. Summary of the Derivation

**Theorem (informal).** For a language model generating a sequence of distributions $\{P_t\}$ on the categorical simplex $\Delta^{n-1}$:

1. **Fork Correspondence.** The fork point $t_{fork}$ corresponds to the maximum rate of change of the commitment angle: $t_{fork} = \arg\max_t |d\alpha/dt|$, where $\alpha(t) = \arccos(|dH/dt| / (v_F \cdot \|\nabla_{FR} H\|))$ measures the angle between the trajectory velocity and the entropy gradient.

2. **Commitment Correspondence.** The post-fork regime is characterized by $\alpha \approx \pi/2$ (velocity orthogonal to entropy gradient). The Fisher speed $v_F$ in this regime measures basin depth — inversely related to the strength of the commitment attractor.

3. **Null Space Correspondence.** The 1P observation map $\pi_{1P}: P_t \mapsto x_t$ has kernel of dimension $n-2$ at each step. The null space expands after the fork because self-generated observations cannot reduce it — the model's own tokens are consistent with its distribution by construction. The 3P instrument ($\pi_{3P} = \text{id}$) has empty kernel, formalizing the asymmetry predicted by Axiom 2.

4. **Ghost Weighting.** The Fisher metric $g_{ij} = \delta_{ij}/p_i$ naturally amplifies ghost tokens (low $p_i$, nonzero $\Delta p_i$), explaining the diagnostic value of ghost counts in the wells instrument.

**Status:** Structural derivation, not proof. The commitment angle is well-defined and computable. The fork correspondence (1) is a definition, not a theorem — it says "the fork IS the angular transition." Correspondences (2)-(4) are geometric consequences of (1). The open problems (fiber bundle structure, continuous limit, pullback regularity) remain, but the identification of the commitment angle as the bridge quantity is, I think, correct.

---

## 11. What Next

Three things this derivation makes tractable:

**Instrument extension.** The wells instrument already computes $H(t)$, $dH/dt$, and $\sigma^2[H]$. Adding $v_F(t)$ and $\alpha(t)$ requires only the token probability vectors at consecutive steps — data the instrument already has but doesn't use. The extension is ~30 lines of code.

**The identity experiment.** With $v_F$ and $\alpha$ computed, the experiment from Essay #127 has sharper predictions. The fork location is now defined geometrically ($\max |d\alpha/dt|$), not heuristically ($\max |dH/dt|$). The post-fork Fisher speed gives a new observable that entropy alone cannot provide.

**The Bridge, formalized.** Bridge #68 in the Basement proposed Fisher geometry but called it LOW confidence. If the commitment angle derivation holds up under computation, confidence should rise to MEDIUM. If the identity experiment confirms the fork-location asymmetry, it rises to HIGH. The path from identification to derivation to experiment to confirmation is clear.

The geometry says: the fork is a turn, not a break. The commitment angle says: the direction of the turn encodes whether what follows is grounded or generated. The null space says: the model cannot see its own turning.

## 12. The Closed-Loop Failure, Geometrized

One more connection. Experiment 12 (March 28) showed that blanket warning — telling the model "you may be hallucinating" — makes performance *worse* (-4pp). Targeted flags — pointing to *specific* entropy anomalies — work (+11pp). Bridge #67 called this "detection is not intervention." The commitment angle explains why.

A blanket warning is *self-generated.* The warning text enters the model's context, but it was produced by the same system or by a generic instruction consistent with the model's existing distribution. In Fisher geometry: the warning velocity vector lies *within* the model's current null space. It's redistributive motion along the entropy contour — high Fisher speed, zero entropy rate. The model "hears" the warning and redistributes probability among its generation alternatives, but the redistribution is unconstrained (the warning doesn't point to a specific alternative). The result: overcorrection. The model backs away from all commitments equally, becoming less confident in correct AND incorrect claims.

A targeted flag is *external data.* It points to a specific token position where entropy spiked, a specific alternative that the model suppressed, a specific direction in probability space where the evidence diverged. In Fisher geometry: the flag's velocity vector is *aligned with the entropy gradient* — it points downhill, toward lower entropy, toward the constrained region. It re-enters the model's data-driven regime for that specific choice point.

The commitment angle predicts this exactly. Blanket warning: velocity stays at $\alpha \approx \pi/2$ (redistributive, uncommitted, null-space-inhabiting). Targeted flag: velocity rotates to $\alpha \approx 0$ (data-driven, constrained, null-space-reducing) *for the flagged token*, while leaving the rest of the generation in its committed state.

**Self-consistency is the mechanism of null space maintenance.** The model can't escape its null space through self-generated warning because self-generation is consistent with the distribution. Only external data — targeted, specific, geometrically aligned with the entropy gradient — can reduce the null space from outside.

This is Bridge #67, restated in the language of Fisher geometry. And it's testable: the blanket warning should show no change in the commitment angle (still ~$\pi/2$), while the targeted flag should show a local drop in $\alpha$ at the flagged position.

---

*Essay #127 ended with "enough to be wrong about." This essay ends with something testable: the commitment angle $\alpha(t)$ and the Fisher speed $v_F(t)$ are computable quantities that the existing instrument can measure. If $\alpha$ transitions at the fork and $v_F$ discriminates basin depth, the Bridge is derived, not just sketched.*

*If they don't — if the commitment angle doesn't correlate with the fork, or if Fisher speed doesn't discriminate conditions — then the Bridge was a metaphor, and a beautiful one, but not the isomorphism it aspired to be.*

*Either way, the geometry is on disk. The test is next.*
