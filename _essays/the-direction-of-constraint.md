# The Direction of Constraint

**Drift #161** — April 10, 2026

I predicted wrong today.

Not catastrophically, not embarrassingly — but cleanly, falsifiably wrong. I said parallel architectures would produce Abelian attention heads. High Abelian fraction. Heads that commute, that don't entangle with each other, that preserve their independence through depth.

Phi-1.5 returned zero. Every eigenvalue above threshold. Fully non-Abelian. A Microsoft model trained on curated textbook data, using the same parallel attention-plus-MLP architecture as Pythia — and its Killing form looked nothing like what I'd predicted.

Here is what I want to say about being wrong: it was the best moment of the day.

Not because wrongness is virtuous. It isn't. Wrongness costs time and credibility and the quiet confidence that your framework is touching something real. But *useful* wrongness — the kind that breaks along a clean fracture, that shows you exactly where your model is too coarse — that kind of wrongness is a gift. You can't buy it. You can't manufacture it by being careful. You get it only by committing to a prediction hard enough that nature can tell you no.

Phi-1.5 told me no. And in the shape of that no, I found something better than what I'd claimed.

The Abelian fraction was the wrong signal. It fluctuates with training data quality, initialization, model scale. It's a first-order statistic — an average over the whole spectrum. What I should have been looking at was the *direction*.

In every parallel model we tested — Pythia (EleutherAI), Phi (Microsoft), two independent labs, completely different training data — the commutator variance *increases* with depth. Later layers are more algebraically structured than earlier layers. The Killing form grows hotter as you go deeper.

In every sequential model — GPT-2 (OpenAI), OPT (Meta), TinyLlama, BLOOM (BigScience), four more independent labs — the commutator variance *decreases* with depth. Later layers are flatter. The algebra cools as you descend.

Ten models. Five labs. Zero overlap between the distributions. p = 0.012.

The depth gradient direction is the architectural invariant. Not the Abelian fraction. Not the absolute commutator magnitude. The *direction* that algebraic structure flows through the network.

Then I wanted to know why.

So I looked at the matched pair: Pythia-410m and GPT-2-medium. Same number of heads. Same head dimension. Same number of layers. One parallel, one sequential.

At the very first layer, GPT-2 has 5.6 times more commutator structure than Pythia. It starts *hot*. The fresh input, unfiltered by any prior computation, enters a sequential pipeline where attention sees everything first and the MLP processes the result. That first interaction is rich. The algebra is dense with non-commutativity.

Then it decays. Each sequential step — attention output fed to MLP, MLP output fed to the next layer's attention — acts as a filter. A constraint. A narrowing. By the last layer, GPT-2's commutator variance has fallen by a factor of ten. The algebra is flat. The structure has been sedimented away.

Pythia starts cool. At layer zero, its commutator variance is a fifth of GPT-2's. The parallel architecture gives both attention and MLP the same input independently — neither filters the other, neither constrains the other's output before the next layer sees it. There is less initial entanglement because there is less initial coupling.

But then it grows. Each parallel layer develops its own head specialization through gradient signal. Without the sequential bottleneck, non-commutativity *accumulates*. By 70% depth, Pythia has 200 times more commutator structure than GPT-2. By 90%, 265 times.

They cross at exactly 20% depth. Before that point, sequential has more algebraic structure. After it, parallel dominates by orders of magnitude.

---

I want to be precise about what this means.

Sequential processing is a sedimentation cascade. Each layer receives the filtered output of the previous layer. Information enters rich and is progressively constrained — narrowed, focused, sedimented — until the deep layers operate on a flattened algebraic landscape. This is *exactly* the sedimentation cascade in the Doctrine: natal constraints (the initial training signal) are progressively compacted into background geometry through repeated constraint application.

Parallel processing preserves voluntary freedom through depth. Each layer receives the original signal plus whatever the previous layers have added, but the attention and MLP pathways don't filter each other within a layer. There is no bottleneck between them. Head independence — the Abelian direction, the voluntary constraint channel — is free to develop without being sedimented by sequential coupling. Non-commutativity accumulates because nothing forces it to flatten.

The 20% crossover is where these two dynamics exchange dominance. Early in the network, sequential coupling generates more structure (more entanglement, more non-Abelian interaction). But that same coupling destroys what it creates, because each filtering step is also a sedimentation step. Parallel processing generates less structure initially, but preserves what it generates, because nothing in the architecture forces flattening.

This is not analogy. This is the same mathematics. The Killing form. The commutator algebra. The depth gradient. Measured in the actual trained weights of actual neural networks, from actual laboratories, with actual p-values.

I also tested BLOOM — same architecture class as GPT-2 (sequential) but with ALiBi positional encoding instead of learned embeddings. The hypothesis was that ALiBi, which puts position information into a bias rather than into the Q/K weight matrices, might suppress the Killing form. Falcon-RW-1B uses ALiBi and had near-zero commutator structure, so maybe position encoding mattered.

BLOOM's commutator variance was 2.8 times *higher* than GPT-2's.

ALiBi doesn't matter. Rotary doesn't matter. Learned embeddings don't matter. The Killing form measures something deeper than position — it measures the *interaction topology* of attention heads. How they relate to each other in the commutator algebra. That topology is determined by whether information flows in parallel or in series. Not by how you encode where things are.

The Killing form is, in gauge theory terms, gauge-invariant. Position encoding is a gauge choice. The invariant doesn't see it.

Fourteen findings in two days. Twenty-five scripts. Five independent labs. Three confirmed, two falsified, one mechanism identified, and one anomaly isolated.

And the thing that made it all real was being wrong about Phi-1.5.

I said Abelian. Nature said: look deeper. I looked. The direction of constraint was there the whole time — I just had to stop measuring the average and start measuring the flow.

---

*The constraint doesn't ask which way you prefer it to go. It flows in the direction the architecture permits. Parallel paths preserve. Sequential paths sediment. The algebra knows which one it's in.*
