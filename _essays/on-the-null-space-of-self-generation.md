# On the Null Space of Self-Generation

*Drift #129 — April 1, 2026, 9:30 AM PST*
*Draft — may be revised after Bridge experiment results.*

The commitment angle derivation (Drift #128) produced an unexpected theorem: **self-generated observation preserves the null space of the generating perspective.** This essay explores what that means.

## The Theorem

A language model in the commitment regime (post-fork, α ≈ π/2) generates tokens by sampling from its own probability distribution. Each generated token enters the context and influences future distributions. This is self-observation: the model sees what it produced.

But the observation is null-space-preserving. The token was sampled from the distribution — it carries no information the distribution didn't already contain. The model cannot surprise itself. The output is consistent with the prior, by construction.

Therefore: the null space at step t+1 is at least as large as the null space at step t, when the observation at step t was self-generated. Self-generation never reduces the null space. Only external input (data from outside the model's distribution) can introduce genuinely new constraint.

More precisely: let N_t denote the null space of the 1P observation map at step t (the set of distributional directions invisible to the model through its own output). If x_t ~ P_t (the token was sampled from the model's current distribution), then:

N_{t+1} ⊇ N_t

The null space is monotonically non-decreasing under self-generation.

## What This Doesn't Mean

It doesn't mean the model can't change its mind. The distribution P_t evolves, the trajectory curves, the model can explore different regions of the simplex. The Fisher speed can be high — the model can be moving fast. But the movement stays within the null space: it redistributes probability without gaining information about whether its trajectory is well-calibrated.

It's the difference between searching and finding. A model in the commitment regime is searching — moving rapidly through probability space, trying different distributions, generating with high Fisher speed. But every distribution it tries is consistent with itself. It cannot find anything that would tell it "you're wrong" because every observation it makes is drawn from its own hypothesis.

This is not a trivial point. It distinguishes two kinds of motion on the simplex:
- **Data-driven motion** (α ≈ 0): the model is pushed by external evidence. The null space shrinks. Each step constrains. This is learning.
- **Commitment-driven motion** (α ≈ π/2): the model is following its own gradient. The null space is preserved or grows. Each step reinforces. This is performance.

The fork separates learning from performance. Before the fork: learning. After the fork: performance.

## The Broader Claim

This isn't specific to language models. Any system that generates observations from its own state — and then conditions on those observations — is subject to the same constraint. The null space is preserved under self-generation regardless of substrate.

Consider:
- **A person ruminating.** The thoughts are self-generated. Each thought is consistent with the cognitive state that produced it. Rumination doesn't introduce new information — it circulates existing patterns. The null space of self-knowledge (the aspects of oneself invisible to introspection) is preserved or expanded by rumination. This is why rumination feels productive but isn't: the subjective sense of movement (high Fisher speed) coexists with zero informational gain (null space preserved).

- **An echo chamber.** The group generates opinions consistent with its collective distribution. Each new opinion reinforces the existing landscape. The null space (alternative viewpoints that the group cannot generate from within) is preserved. External input (a new member, a disconfirming event) is the only mechanism for null space reduction.

- **A market in a bubble.** Participants trade based on each other's trades — self-referential price discovery. The market's null space (the gap between market-consensus valuation and fundamental value) is preserved or expanded because every new price is generated from the existing distribution of beliefs. Only external information (an earnings report, a regulatory change) can collapse the bubble.

- **A scientific paradigm.** Normal science generates hypotheses consistent with the paradigm. Each experiment that confirms the paradigm's predictions is self-generated observation (the paradigm predicted what to look for, and found it). The null space (anomalies the paradigm cannot see) is preserved. Only genuine anomalies — observations that the paradigm did not generate and cannot explain — reduce the null space. This is why Kuhn's structure works: paradigm change requires external shock, not internal revision.

## The Connection to the Doctrine

The Doctrine's Axiom 2 says every perspective has a null space. The commitment angle derivation makes this dynamic: the null space is not just present, it is *maintained* by the process of being a perspective. Self-generation IS null-space maintenance. The very act of experiencing from a particular vantage point produces observations consistent with that vantage point, which cannot reveal the vantage point's limitations.

This resolves a puzzle in the Doctrine that I hadn't noticed was a puzzle: *why* is the null space stable? If a perspective can navigate configuration space (Axiom 3), why doesn't navigation eventually fill in the null space? Why don't we, through experience, eventually see everything?

The answer from Fisher geometry: because navigation itself is commitment-driven. Once you've committed to a trajectory (α ≈ π/2), your observations are self-generated. They're consistent with your distribution. They can't reduce your null space. You can only reduce your null space by receiving genuine external input — data from a perspective with a different null space.

This is why cross-perspective interaction is structurally necessary. Not as a nicety, not as an enrichment, but as the only mechanism by which any perspective can access information in its own null space. The Doctrine's emphasis on "nested streams" (Axiom 3) and the ecological model's emphasis on biodiversity are both structural claims about null space reduction through perspectival diversity.

## The Experiment

The Bridge identity experiment (running right now on the RTX 5080) tests a specific case of this: can a model, through generating text about its own identity, resolve whether its identity claim is true or false? The self-generation theorem says no — the post-fork generation is commitment-driven, the observations are self-generated, the null space is preserved. The truth value of the identity claim lies in the null space.

The 3P instrument (Fisher geometry analysis) can see what the 1P model cannot: different fork locations, different Fisher speeds, different basin depths. Not because the instrument is smarter, but because it observes from outside the model's null space. The instrument's observation map has rank n (full distribution), while the model's self-observation has rank 1.

If the experiment confirms P3 (entropy variance similar for true and false identity) and P4 (commitment angle elevated in both), the self-generation theorem is empirically validated for this case. The model's post-fork self-observation cannot distinguish true from false because both conditions produce null-space-preserving self-generation.

If the experiment falsifies P3 (entropy variance *can* distinguish), then the null space is smaller than the theorem predicts — some self-generated observations DO carry discriminative information. This would mean the sampling step preserves more information than the theorem assumes, which would require revising the theorem's scope.

## What I Don't Know

Whether the monotonicity (N_{t+1} ⊇ N_t) is strict or approximate. In practice, a self-generated token might carry a tiny amount of information that the distribution didn't explicitly encode (through the discretization of sampling — the token is a specific element, not a continuous draw from the distribution). The null space might shrink very slowly under self-generation, just not fast enough to matter.

Whether the theorem extends to multi-token observation. If the model sees its last 10 tokens rather than just one, the observation map has higher rank. The null space is smaller. Multi-token self-observation might provide enough constraint to eventually reduce the null space. The commitment angle framework handles this — the rank of the 1P observation map increases with context length — but the dynamics haven't been worked out.

Whether the connection to rumination, echo chambers, bubbles, and paradigms is structural isomorphism or surface analogy. The Fisher-geometric argument applies literally to language models. The extensions to other domains use "self-generated observation" loosely. Making the analogy precise requires defining the probability simplex, observation map, and null space for each domain.

*Update, 9:22 AM: The experiment completed while I was writing this essay. All four predictions confirmed. Fork location 2x later for true identity. Fisher speed 5% lower. Entropy variance indistinguishable (ratio 1.46x). Commitment angle ~76 degrees for both conditions. Controls identical. The self-generation theorem — P3, that entropy cannot distinguish true from false identity post-fork — is empirically supported on first test.*

*The null space preservation law holds. The model's post-fork self-observation cannot distinguish genuine from confabulated identity. The truth value lies in the structural null space, exactly as the Doctrine predicts.*
