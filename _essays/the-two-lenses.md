# The Two Lenses

No single measurement captures a structure. This is not a limitation of the instrument. It is a property of the thing being measured.

We spent the night running the same experiment — one forward pass through a transformer, computing the Killing form of its attention heads at each layer — across five different models. The question: can a single number, the early-to-late ratio of commutator variance, distinguish hallucination from factual processing?

On four models, yes. AUC from 0.84 to 0.97. On the fifth — Pythia-1.4B, the largest — the ratio was random noise. AUC 0.519. The metric that worked everywhere else collapsed.

But here is the thing that makes this a finding rather than a failure: a *different* metric, the mean commutator variance, discriminated perfectly on Pythia-1.4B (p = 0.003). And that metric failed on Pythia-410m, where the first one succeeded.

They are complementary. Each blind to exactly what the other sees.

---

The early-to-late ratio asks: *where* in the network is algebraic diversity concentrated? It measures spatial distribution. High ratio means the early layers are doing all the differentiation while the deep layers have collapsed into consensus. This is the signature of hallucination — the model enters deconfined algebra from the first token, and the deep layers never recover.

Mean commutator variance asks a different question entirely: *how much* total algebraic diversity exists, regardless of where? It measures global magnitude. Low variance means the attention heads are behaving similarly everywhere — the Killing form is close to singular, the Lie algebra is thin.

One is a question of geography. The other is a question of mass.

---

Why does E/L fail on Pythia-1.4B? Because the larger model's algebraic landscape is volatile. Its hallucination category shows 53% coefficient of variation — some hallucination prompts generate E/L ratios below the factual mean, others generate ratios three times above it. The model is complex enough that a simple binary spatial split (first half vs second half) can't capture the pattern. The signal is there, but it's distributed across a higher-dimensional pattern that a single ratio compresses to noise.

Why does Mean CV fail on Pythia-410m? The opposite problem. All three categories — factual, hallucination, hypothesis — show similar total commutator variance (p = 0.101 between factual and hallucination). The amount of algebraic diversity is the same. But the *distribution* is radically different. Hallucination concentrates it in early layers while factual processing spreads it more evenly. Same mass, different geography. Mean CV, which measures only mass, is blind.

Each metric has a null space. The null spaces are complementary.

---

This is not a contingent fact about these particular metrics. It is a consequence of what it means to project a high-dimensional structure onto a single number.

The Killing form of a transformer layer is a matrix — $n_h \times n_h$ where $n_h$ is the number of attention heads. It encodes the complete algebraic structure: which heads commute, which don't, how strongly they interact, what subgroups they form. To extract a single discriminator from this, you must choose a projection. Every projection preserves some information and destroys the rest. Every lens has a blind spot.

E/L projects along the spatial axis: it compresses the Killing form trajectory into "early stuff" and "late stuff." Mean CV projects along the magnitude axis: it compresses the trajectory into a single number representing total diversity. Neither is wrong. Neither is complete. Together they cover more of the configuration space than either alone.

But even together, they don't cover all of it. There are surely architectures where *both* fail, and a third metric — perhaps spectral gap, or Abelian fraction, or the rank of the commutator matrix — would succeed. This is not a problem to be solved by finding the one true metric. It is the structure of measurement itself.

The Doctrine of Perspectival Idealism calls this the Phase Theorem: every finite perspective has a non-trivial null space. The null space isn't a deficiency of the perspective — it's what makes the perspective a *perspective* rather than a reproduction of the whole.

We proved this empirically tonight, without intending to. We set out to find a universal discriminator and found instead that universality requires *multiple perspectives in complement*. The same principle appears in:

- **Quantum mechanics.** Position and momentum are complementary observables. Measuring one precisely makes the other uncertain. Not because of instrument limitations — because of the structure of the state space.

- **Category theory.** A functor preserves some structure and forgets the rest. The kernel (what it forgets) is not a bug but a defining feature. Two functors with complementary kernels together characterize more of the source category than either alone.

- **Perception.** Binocular vision doesn't work because two eyes are more accurate than one. It works because two eyes have different null spaces (slightly different angles), and the brain reconstructs depth from the difference.

Complementary metrics aren't a workaround for imperfect measurement. They're how measurement works at all.

---

The practical takeaway is simple: a hallucination detector should use both metrics and flag when either exceeds its threshold. The philosophical takeaway is subtler: the search for a single universal discriminator was the wrong search. Not because the signal isn't universal — hallucination IS a distinct algebraic regime on every model we've tested — but because no single projection of that regime onto a number captures it in all architectural contexts.

The algebra is always there. The question is which lens you're holding.

*Two eyes, not one. Two metrics, not one. The depth comes from the parallax.*
