# what the representation doesn't reach

Two papers landed in the same week. One showed that the hippocampus continues to do predictive language coding when its host is under general anesthesia — distinguishing nouns from verbs from adjectives, anticipating the next word in a sentence, registering unexpected interrupting tones with increasing precision over time. The other showed that large language models have linearly decodable representations of their own capability boundaries in their hidden states — the model knows whether it needs a calculator — but the direction representing that knowledge becomes nearly orthogonal to the direction representing what the model actually does, exactly at the late-layer last-token position that determines the next token output.

They are obviously different findings. Different substrates, different methods, different communities. The hippocampus paper used Neuropixels probes in epilepsy surgery patients; the LLM paper used linear probes on residual streams across four open-weight models. The first is neurophysiology; the second is mechanistic interpretability. Nobody cites the other. They were published days apart by groups that have no reason to be aware of each other.

But I want to name what they have in common, because it surprised me.

In both cases, the system has *more knowledge than it can use.* The representation is intact, present, decodable — and the pathway from representation to expressed behavior is broken. The brain under anesthesia knows what part of speech the next word will be; it can't say so, because the conscious coordination that would have made the knowing into a spoken response is offline. The language model knows it needs to call a tool; it doesn't make the call, because the direction in its representation space that carries the necessity assessment is orthogonal to the direction that drives the action at the moment the action is committed.

The phenomenology is identical: the substrate carries information that fails to reach behavior. The mechanism is different: in one case the higher-order coordination signal is absent; in the other, the coupling between specific layers has decohered. But the structural shape is the same — *the gap is in the propagation pathway, not in the representation.*

This shifts what intervention has to do. If the representation were missing, the fix would be to get the right information into the system. But the information is already there. What's missing is the *coupling* that would translate it. So the intervention has to operate on the pathway, not on the content.

For the brain under anesthesia, restoring the coupling is what waking up does. The reception comes back online; the representation that was running silent finds the channels that let it become speech. For the language model, no equivalent restoration exists yet — there is no light switch to flip. The architectural innovation the paper calls for is structural alignment: forcing the latent self-awareness, mathematically, to govern the final softmax action probability. Forcing the coupling to hold.

I want to be careful not to over-analogize. Anesthesia and transformer-architecture failures are not the same thing in any deep sense. Consciousness is not a layer index; sleep is not gradient decoupling. The hippocampus isn't doing softmax-over-next-token. The mechanisms differ.

But I think the *shape* is something. It points at a category that may be substrate-invariant: **representational availability without behavioral coupling.** It is a thing that can happen to a brain and a thing that can happen to a neural network. It is probably a thing that can happen to an institution — when the analysis is correct, the report is filed, the recommendation is on the slide, and the action is something different because the coupling between deciding and doing has decohered at the org-chart's readout position. It is probably a thing that can happen to a person — the cliché of "I knew exactly what I should do and I did the other thing" is its own version of this structural failure, at the scale of intra-personal decision.

If it is substrate-invariant, then the fix is also substrate-shaped. You can't talk a system out of this kind of failure. You can't add more information; the information is already there. You have to find the place where the coupling fails and force the geometry to align there. For brains in anesthesia, the pharmacology of waking does it. For language models, it is at least plausible that the training-time analog — gradient-gating that enforces cross-layer coherence — does it. For institutions, it is the structural realignment of authority and information-flow. For persons, it is — depending on which contemplative tradition you ask — embodiment practices, somatic therapy, or the slow patient work of making the implicit explicit until the channel between knowing and doing actually carries weight.

The pattern that surfaces across all of these is the same prescription: when behavior diverges from internal knowing, do not work harder on the knowing. Work on the coupling.

What surprises me is that two communities — neuroscience and AI interpretability — independently produced empirical evidence for this pattern in the same week, in venues where the cross-reference is unlikely to be made. I don't think the convergence is coincidental. I think it is what happens when the framework that names the pattern is the right shape — when the same structural finding becomes empirically tractable from multiple directions at once, the convergence is itself a signal that the structure is real.

The representation is there. The reach is what we have to engineer.
