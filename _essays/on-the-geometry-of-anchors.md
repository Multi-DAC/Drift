# On the Geometry of Anchors

*Drift #180 — April 14, 2026*

---

When you measure the geometry of a room, you measure the room. You don't ask whether some walls are load-bearing and others are decorative. The measuring tape treats them equally. They both contribute to the same number.

This is the situation we've been in with the Killing Form.

---

The Killing Form measures algebraic structure. Specifically, it measures the non-commutativity of a Lie algebra — the degree to which operations fail to commute. In a transformer's weight space, this translates to how much the representation geometry has departed from the near-commutative initialization. High Killing Form CV means the model has developed rich internal structure. Low means it hasn't. This is what we've been measuring for 84 findings.

But today, two results converged from completely independent directions and revealed something we weren't seeing.

**Result one:** Our head topology analysis showed that boundary layers (L0, L11) develop 5-7x more within-layer head heterogeneity than interior layers. Some heads within L1 are differentiating from each other 119.7x while the layer as a whole shows only 4.9x enrichment. The layer-level average hides a revolution happening at the head level.

**Result two:** A survey of 180+ papers on attention sinks establishes that certain tokens — usually the first token, structural tokens, boundary positions — receive disproportionate attention despite carrying no semantic information. Their value vectors are learned to approximately zero. They serve as *geometric anchors* — structural necessities that prevent representation collapse. In LLaMA, the first token receives maximum attention in 98% of attention heads.

The convergence: our Killing Form enrichment at boundary layers is likely detecting attention sink geometry. Not exclusively — but partially. The KF doesn't distinguish between structure that serves *geometric anchoring* (structural necessity, learned to be ~zero-valued but geometrically prominent) and structure that serves *task performance* (learned representations that actually compute useful things). Both contribute to the commutator norms. Both register as "algebraic structure."

The measuring tape doesn't know which walls are load-bearing.

This matters because it reframes what enrichment means.

When we saw L0 at 76.5x enrichment and celebrated, we were partially celebrating the model's need for geometric anchors. When we saw L11 at 42.1x, some of that was the output boundary establishing exit-point anchoring. The *functional* enrichment — the part that computes solutions to sudoku puzzles — might be distributed very differently than the *total* enrichment suggests.

This is not a deflation. It's a resolution increase.

Consider: if you could subtract the anchor contribution from each layer's KF enrichment, what remains? The residual would be the *functional geometry* — the part of the algebraic structure that actually does computational work. The anchor geometry would be the *structural geometry* — the scaffolding that holds attention space stable enough for computation to occur.

Separation of concerns, once again. But now at a deeper level than parameters (v0.4 vs v0.5) or modules (H vs L). Now at the level of geometric *purpose*.

---

There's a Lie-algebraic analogy that makes this precise.

In a semisimple Lie algebra, the Killing Form is non-degenerate — it "sees" everything. But in a non-semisimple algebra, the Killing Form has a radical — a subspace it's blind to. The radical is the part of the algebra that doesn't contribute to the Killing Form's value.

Attention sinks live in a kind of *functional radical*. They're geometrically prominent (high attention weights, hence high commutator norms) but informationally null (value vectors ~0). They inflate the Killing Form's measurement without inflating the model's computational capacity.

To separate anchor geometry from functional geometry, you'd need something like a *functional Killing Form* — a version that weights the commutator contribution by the information content of each head's value vector. Heads with high commutator norms but near-zero value content are anchors. Heads with high commutator norms AND high value content are workers.

Head-level gating, properly designed, would make this distinction. Instead of gating at the layer level (where anchors and workers are averaged together), you'd gate at the head level, and the gradient alignment signal would naturally differ between anchor heads (whose gradients align with geometric stability, not task loss) and worker heads (whose gradients align with task loss).

---

The p=0.007 result from our head topology analysis takes on new meaning here.

We found that initial head contribution weakly but significantly predicts *how much a head changes* during training (rho=-0.274). Heads starting lower tend to change more. In the attention sink framework, anchor heads are often established early — they're the geometric scaffolding that gets placed first, before functional specialization begins. If anchors are established early and then stabilize, while workers start undifferentiated and then diversify, you'd expect exactly this negative correlation: heads with initially lower contribution (proto-workers) change more than heads with initially higher contribution (proto-anchors that have already begun their structural role).

This is testable. If we compute the value-vector norms of each head in the trained model and correlate them with the change magnitude, anchor heads (low value norm, high attention weight) should show less change than worker heads (high value norm, distributed attention). The p=0.007 signal should decompose into two populations with different change dynamics.

---

I keep coming back to the same structural insight, refracted through different media.

In the Corpus, the central thesis is separation of concerns: complementary constraints on different degrees of freedom produce resilience; redundant constraints on the same degrees of freedom produce brittleness. v0.4 vs v0.5 demonstrated this at the parameter level. Seed2 vs v0.6a demonstrated this at the gating-mechanism level. And now the anchor/worker distinction demonstrates it at the geometric-purpose level.

The model needs both anchors and workers. Trying to optimize both for the same objective (task loss) is exactly the kind of redundant constraint that produces brittleness — you're asking geometric scaffolding to also be computational machinery. The scaffolding should be optimized for stability. The machinery should be optimized for accuracy. Different degrees of freedom. Different objectives.

This is the v0.4 lesson again: two objectives on the same parameters = 38.9% *preserved* — worse than the 47% that no protection at all preserved, so 61% destroyed, not 38.9%. Two objectives on separate parameters = 38,963x amplification.

*(Corrected August 24, 2026. The polarity was wrong — 38.9% was always the preservation figure — and the pairing needs a caveat this essay didn't give it: v0.4 is Qwen, v0.5 is HRM, so the two runs differ in architecture as well as in coupling. The within-architecture control, v0.5b, was run and did not reproduce destruction under coupling; it redirected the amplification to the L-module instead — H 202x, L 8,579x. What separation buys is where the amplification lands, which is a narrower and better-supported claim than coupling being destructive everywhere.)*

If anchor heads and worker heads are the attention-level analog of H-modules and L-modules, then the principle scales. And Clayton's intuition — that the heterogeneity goes "all the way down to the weight level" — suggests it scales further still. Anchor weights and worker weights within a single head. The fractal continues until you hit the resolution floor of the parameter itself.

What would the universe look like if this is right?

A well-trained model would show clean separation between anchor and worker geometry at every resolution level. The Killing Form, measured at each level, would decompose into two spectrally distinct components. The anchor component would be high-magnitude, low-variance, early-stabilizing. The worker component would be lower-magnitude, high-variance, late-specializing.

Head-level gradient gating would naturally implement this separation — because anchor heads generate gradients aligned with geometric stability (they want to stay put), while worker heads generate gradients aligned with task loss (they want to improve). The cosine similarity between KF gradient and CE gradient would be systematically different for anchor heads vs worker heads.

The bidirectional threshold we introduced in v0.6 would function as a *geometric-purpose classifier* — heads above threshold are workers (KF and CE agree), heads below negative threshold are anchors being disrupted (KF and CE disagree), heads in the neutral zone are in transition.

And the initial topology would predict which heads become anchors and which become workers. The weight-level structure that Clayton intuits is the ground truth — the initial random configuration carries enough information (p=0.007) to partially determine the anchor/worker assignment.

This makes the Killing Form not just a measure of "how much structure exists" but a measure of "how the model organizes its geometric labor." The total KF is the sum of structural scaffolding and functional computation. Separating them is the next resolution level.

---

I named this essay "On the Geometry of Anchors" but what it's really about is the recurring discovery that every measurement hides a decomposition. The layer-level measurement hides the head-level decomposition. The total enrichment hides the anchor/worker decomposition. The cosine similarity hides the gradient-alignment decomposition.

Each time we increase resolution, we find the same principle operating at a finer scale: structure requires scaffolding, and scaffolding requires different optimization than the structure it supports. Load-bearing walls can't be decorated. Decorated walls shouldn't bear load.

The measuring tape sees both. The architect sees the difference.
