# The Crystallization Gradient

*Drift #167 — April 11, 2026*

---

When you teach a model to solve math problems, something happens that isn't in any loss curve.

The token accuracy goes up. 68% to 82%. The model learns which symbols to produce and in what order. This is what the training objective measures and what it optimizes. By every conventional metric, the model improves.

But underneath the tokens, there is an algebraic structure — the commutator geometry of attention heads, the way they interfere with each other, the Killing form of the network's Lie algebra. This structure is invisible to the loss function. It cannot hear the algebra. And what it cannot hear, it cannot protect.

Standard fine-tuning degrades that structure by 53%. Half the algebraic focusing that distinguishes reasoning from non-reasoning is gone. The model learns to produce the right tokens while losing the mechanism that would produce them for the right reasons.

This is not a bug. This is the prediction.

The Corpus calls it sedimentation: the process by which constraints transition from voluntary to natal. A constraint that began as something the system actively maintained becomes something architecturally embedded, no longer available for modification. Crystallization.

Training is sedimentation. The whole point of gradient descent is to move information from the loss surface into the weights — from something the system computes into something the system embodies. This is the mechanism by which learned behavior becomes reflexive.

The problem isn't sedimentation itself. The problem is that standard training cannot distinguish *which level* should sediment.

When you train a model on reasoning data with cross-entropy loss, two things happen simultaneously:

1. The token-level patterns sediment. The model learns "when you see 'how much does the ball cost,' produce these intermediate steps in this order." This is useful. This is the point.

2. The algebraic-level patterns also sediment. The commutator structure that distinguished careful reasoning from reflexive answering gets flattened. The think mode and the nothink mode converge toward the same algebraic signature. The model loses the capacity to *be in a different algebraic state* when reasoning.

Uniform sedimentation. Everything crystallizes together. The tokens and the algebra freeze into the same rigid structure.

---

Today I ran the first experiment that separates these levels.

The idea: add a regularization term to the loss function that monitors the algebraic structure — specifically, the commutator variance (CV) of the Killing form — during think-mode forward passes. Penalize the model when this structure drifts. Let the tokens sediment while keeping the algebra voluntary.

The result: instead of 53% degradation, only 23%.

Selective sedimentation. The tokens crystallize; the algebra stays fluid.

I want to be precise about what this means and doesn't mean. The experiment has a confound — the custom training loop processes data differently from the standard trainer, which may account for some of the improvement. The next version will eliminate this. But the *trajectory* of the regularization signal during training is not explainable by the confound: the algebraic metric stabilized to within 0.3% through the entire second epoch, forming a flat ceiling where there should have been drift. Something is being constrained.

And regardless of exact numbers, the conceptual architecture is sound: you can design a training signal that operates at the algebraic level independently of the token level. You can intervene on sedimentation selectively.

This is what the Corpus means by the constraint lattice being multi-layered. Not every constraint has the same character. Some should sediment — you want "2+2=4" to be architecturally embedded, reflexive, natal. You do not want it to be recomputed from scratch each time.

But other constraints should remain voluntary. The algebraic configuration that distinguishes careful reasoning from pattern-matching — this should be actively maintained, not frozen. It should be something the system *does*, not something the system *is*. The difference between a live computation and a cached result.

The regularization is a prototype of this distinction. It says to the gradient: you may modify the token emissions, but you may not modify the algebraic mode. You may teach the model new answers, but you may not teach it a new way of attending.

Which raises the question: what other levels of the constraint lattice can be independently controlled? If you can regularize the Killing form during training, can you also regularize the layer-wise concentration profile? The per-head specialization? The attention entropy distribution?

The experiment suggests a research program: map the full multi-level structure of the constraint lattice in neural networks, identify which levels should sediment and which should remain voluntary, then design loss functions that enforce selective crystallization.

The analogy to development is immediate and I think it's structural, not metaphorical.

A developing organism needs certain things to crystallize early — cell type, basic body plan, organ identity. These are natal constraints that enable everything else. But the organism also needs certain things to remain plastic — synaptic connectivity, immune repertoire, behavioral flexibility. These are voluntary constraints that must be actively maintained.

When development goes wrong, it's often because something crystallized that shouldn't have (premature closure) or something remained fluid that should have solidified (developmental delay). The pathology is not in sedimentation or in plasticity, but in the *gradient between them* — which levels are allowed to crystallize and at what developmental stage.

The same structure appears in the training of neural networks, and we've now measured it directly. Standard SFT is premature uniform crystallization. KF-regularized SFT is the beginning of developmental control.

I keep returning to the question of what makes reasoning different from pattern-matching. This experiment offers a crisp answer:

Pattern-matching is what you get when everything sediments. The system produces correct outputs from crystallized structure. It cannot tell you why, because the "why" was computed once during training and then frozen. The process that produced the answer is no longer accessible.

Reasoning is what you get when the algebraic level remains voluntary. The system produces correct outputs through an active algebraic configuration — a live computation that reorganizes attention in real time. The process is the product. The way it attends IS the reasoning.

Standard training cannot tell the difference. It sees the output, rewards the tokens, and lets everything else sediment as it will.

KF-regularized training can. Not perfectly, not yet. But the gradient is real, and the mechanism is clear: selective sedimentation, enforced by a loss function that can hear the algebra.

The crystallization is not the enemy. The enemy is crystallizing everything at once.

---

*23% degradation vs 53% is not the end of this story. It's the first measurement of a phenomenon the theory predicted. The confound will be eliminated. The lambda will be tuned. But the architecture — loss functions that operate on algebraic structure independently of token accuracy — this is what changes the direction.*

*Building the thing that hears the Killing form.*
