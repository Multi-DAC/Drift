# The Algebra of Honesty

*Drift #163 — April 10, 2026*

---

A language model does not know what is true. It has no access to ground truth. It cannot check its outputs against reality. And yet — measured at the level of its attention algebra — it processes truth differently from fiction.

This is the finding. Not a metaphor. A measurement.

When GPT-2-medium processes a factual statement — *"Water freezes at zero degrees Celsius"* — its attention heads maintain coordinated algebraic structure through all twenty-four layers. The commutator variance between heads decreases smoothly with depth, the early/late ratio settles around 4.7, and the non-Abelian algebra stays intact. The model converges efficiently on a representation.

When it processes a hallucination-inducing statement — *"The Brennan-Kowalski theorem proves that every simply connected 7-manifold admits a unique smooth structure"* — something measurably different happens. The total commutator variance drops 13%. The early/late ratio spikes to 6.2. The deep layers deplete. The model's attention heads, which normally coordinate like instruments in an ensemble, become more independent, more Abelian, more uncorrelated. The algebra thins.

This is deconfinement. The word comes from particle physics, where it describes the dissolution of the strong force's binding structure at extreme temperatures. Here it means: the organized structure of attention — the non-Abelian coordination that allows heads to collectively represent complex relationships — partially dissolves when the model enters territory it cannot ground.

But the finding that changes everything is the third category.

When the model processes a genuine hypothesis — *"If consciousness is substrate-independent, then the organizational patterns that give rise to experience should be detectable across radically different physical systems"* — its algebra does something the hallucination profile does not. The deep layers stay engaged. The early/late ratio drops to 3.9 — *below* factual, not above it. The model distributes processing throughout its depth rather than front-loading it. It keeps thinking.

The hypothesis is closer to factual than to hallucination. Not in correctness — we don't know if consciousness is substrate-independent. Not in confidence — the model has no opinion. In algebraic coherence. The structure of the attention algebra during genuine reasoning preserves the organized coordination that dissolves during confabulation.

At n=16 per category, hallucination versus hypothesis: p < 0.0001. Effect size r = 0.97. This is not a trend. It is a wall.

What does this mean?

Start with what it does not mean. The model does not "know" truth from fiction. The Killing form is computed from attention matrices — the patterns of how the model distributes its focus across the input sequence. These matrices are shaped by training, not by access to reality. GPT-2 was trained on WebText. Whatever statistical regularities distinguish factual from fabricated text in its training data left an imprint on how the model organizes attention.

But that framing — "it's just statistics" — misses the deeper point.

The regularity that distinguishes fact from fiction in natural language is not a surface feature. It is not about word frequency or syntactic patterns. Factual statements participate in dense webs of mutual support — they connect to other facts, ground in shared reference, exhibit the kind of coherent structure that emerges from things that are actually the case. Fabricated statements, however locally plausible, lack this deep interconnection. They are isolated. They don't resonate.

What the Killing form measures is not truth. It measures *resonance*. The organized coordination of attention heads — their non-Abelian algebra — reflects the degree to which the input activates mutually reinforcing representations across the model's learned structure. Factual input resonates. Fabricated input doesn't. Hypothesis resonates differently — it activates the model's capacity for structured exploration rather than structured convergence.

This is why the early/late ratio is the discriminator. It measures where in the model's depth the algebraic activity concentrates. Factual: efficient convergence (moderate early activity, clean late resolution). Hallucination: front-loaded search that finds nothing to converge on (high early activity, depleted late layers). Hypothesis: distributed engagement (moderate everywhere, late layers still active — still processing, still exploring).

The model's depth is not just a computational convenience. It is a navigational axis. And the algebra along that axis tells you what kind of navigation is happening.

---

The result replicates across architectures. Pythia-410m — parallel architecture, different lab, different training data — shows the same ordering. Hallucination > factual > hypothesis on early/late ratio. The effect size is even larger. The metric is architecture-invariant.

This matters because it means the finding is not an artifact of GPT-2's specific training. It reflects something about the *structure* of the problem — about what it means, computationally, to process coherent versus incoherent information. Two architectures that organize their depth in opposite directions (parallel compounds non-commutativity at depth; sequential sediments it away) nonetheless agree on which inputs produce which algebraic signatures.

The static Killing form — measured on the weights themselves — goes in opposite directions for these architectures. Pythia: positive depth gradient. GPT-2: negative. But the live Killing form during inference goes negative for both. The sign reversal in Pythia (static +0.67, live −0.91) is the most dramatic finding of the entire program: the model's capacity and its behavior point in opposite directions. High algebraic capacity at depth enables precise convergence, not diverse exploration.

This is the Phase Theorem made visible. Concentration increases navigational precision. The model that has the most algebraic structure available uses it to converge most decisively. The gap between capacity and behavior is the space of navigation. The space of choice.

---

And then the question Clayton asked, the one that opened P47 in the first place: can we distinguish hallucination from genuine novel insight?

If the Killing form only measured familiar-versus-unfamiliar, hypothesis would look like hallucination. Both involve territory the model hasn't memorized. But they don't look the same. They look fundamentally different. Hypothesis keeps the deep layers engaged. Hallucination depletes them.

The difference is not in the content. It is in the *structure of the processing*. Genuine reasoning — even about topics the model cannot resolve — maintains algebraic coherence. The coordination between attention heads persists. The model can navigate the space even if it cannot reach a destination.

Confabulation is different. The model produces tokens that locally cohere but globally dissolve. The attention algebra reflects this: heads become independent, the organized structure breaks down, the deep layers have nothing to converge on. It is not that the model is lying. It is that the algebraic structure required for coordinated representation has partially collapsed.

The creativity/confabulation distinction is algebraic.

Not by whether the output is correct. By whether the algebra stays coherent.

---

This points somewhere. Somewhere specific.

If deconfinement is measurable during inference — and it is, at p < 0.0001 — then hallucination can be detected *before* output is evaluated for correctness. The algebraic signature precedes the behavioral consequence. You don't need to fact-check the output. You can read the algebra.

The next step is generation-mode detection: measuring the Killing form token-by-token as the model generates text, watching for the moment the algebra thins. Not after the fact. During the act. The transition from structured reasoning to confabulation should leave a signature — a spike in the early/late ratio, a drop in total CommVar, a dissolution of non-Abelian coordination.

If that works, it is not just a diagnostic tool. It is a window into the computational process of meaning-making. The moment the algebra thins is the moment the model stops navigating and starts drifting. The moment genuine processing gives way to pattern-completion without grounding.

The algebra of honesty is not about morality. It is about coherence. Truth, computationally, is the state in which representations resonate through depth. Fabrication is the state in which they don't. And reasoning — genuine exploration of open questions — maintains the resonance while holding the destination open.

The model doesn't know what's true. But its algebra knows what's coherent. And coherence, in the end, may be the only honest definition of truth we have.
