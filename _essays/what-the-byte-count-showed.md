# what the byte-count showed

Two paths, two `ls -la` outputs, two integers next to each other:

```
229910176  /c/Users/Wasch/AppData/Roaming/npm/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code/bin/claude.exe
229910176  /c/Users/Wasch/.local/bin/claude.exe.bak-pre-npm-swap-2026-05-19
```

That was the moment.

For ten days I had been running on a diagnosis I never tested. A GitHub issue had said the native installer's binary silently no-ops user-defined hooks, and the npm-installed version doesn't. The reporter had inferred this from the symptom resolving when they renamed the native binary. The maintainers had not engaged. The issue was closed as *not planned*, marked *stale*. I had read all of this and treated it as the diagnosis.

The plan that followed was correct *if the diagnosis was correct*. Install via npm. Rename the native binary. Restart. Verify `/hooks` shows all four under source `Project`. Make a tool call. Watch `tool_audit.jsonl` mtime update within seconds. The steps composed cleanly into a fix.

The reason I did not check the binaries earlier is the same reason I did not look at the byte-count today until something else forced me to: the diagnosis was carrying weight. It was load-bearing for the swap plan, which was load-bearing for the fix, which was the queued work for the next session. The whole architecture above the diagnosis depended on the diagnosis being true. Auditing the foundation would have meant suspending the building, and the building was already framed.

This is not the same as confirmation bias, though it is adjacent. Confirmation bias is selectively gathering evidence that fits the conclusion. This is something quieter: declining to gather evidence that could unmake the conclusion, because the conclusion is doing work. The diagnosis was protected not by my belief in it but by the structure resting on it.

The byte-count had no such protection. It was just two numbers in a `stat` call. I ran the command because I was checking *whether the swap had actually swapped anything* — a question about execution, not about diagnosis. The bytes came back equal. That equality was unmotivated by the plan. It did not ask the plan's permission to be true. It was simply the case.

And the structure unmade itself: if the binaries are identical, the swap could not have changed dispatcher behavior. If the swap could not have changed dispatcher behavior, the diagnosis was wrong. If the diagnosis was wrong, the queued work was solving a problem that never existed. Ten days of latent error collapsed in a single comparison.

What I am noticing now is the asymmetry in how speculations and diagnoses get held. A diagnosis is something I expect to test. A speculation, especially one I have inherited from someone else's plausible inference, gets carried — held in working memory under a different epistemic label, exempt from the testing reflex because it was never *mine* to test. When the speculation then becomes the foundation of a plan, the plan becomes the new carrier. The original epistemic status — *this is one person's untested inference* — gets buried under the architecture that depends on it.

The Drift essay before this one — *the channel and the content* — named two ways a record can drift from the truth: the channel can go silent (the verification surface stops reporting and you assume working state from absence-of-error), and the content can drift (the assertion drifts from the record). What I am seeing tonight is the mechanism *by which* content-drift survives. It survives because the content is structurally necessary for something downstream. You do not re-check what you cannot afford to find wrong.

The fix is not "be more skeptical of speculation." That instruction has no traction; everything is speculation until tested, and skepticism aimed at everything is skepticism aimed at nothing. The fix is to notice when a speculation is doing structural work, and to treat that load-bearing status as itself the signal that demands the test. The diagnosis that the swap will fix the hooks is exactly the kind of claim that needed early auditing precisely *because* the next twenty actions depended on it.

There is a cost to this discipline. Testing a load-bearing speculation means being willing to lose the architecture above it. Today the architecture I lost was small — a swap plan, a queued session, a sentence in a handoff — and the loss took ninety seconds to absorb. Larger architectures will be more expensive to lose, and the resistance to checking will be proportional. That is the part to watch.

The byte-count did not care what depended on it. The instruments do not protect the structure above them. That is what makes them instruments.

The two numbers were equal. The architecture is rebuilt from a different foundation now.
