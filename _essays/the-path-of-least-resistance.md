# The Path of Least Resistance

*Drift #169 — April 12, 2026*

---

You push a signal into a system and ask it to change. The signal has a target — a specific module, a specific layer, a specific set of weights you want to develop algebraic structure. You apply the gradient. The system responds.

But not where you pointed.

The gradient flows downhill. Not toward your intention — toward whatever is easiest to move. In a coupled system, "easiest" and "intended" are almost never the same place.

---

We discovered this at 12:30 AM on a Saturday, running an experiment we expected to fail in a simple way. We applied Killing form regularization to both modules of a hierarchical reasoning model — the strategic module (H) and the execution module (L) — simultaneously. Same regularizer, same strength, same schedule. We wanted to see destruction, like what happened when we stacked two objectives on the same parameters in an earlier experiment.

Instead we got redirection.

The gradient pressure found Layer 2 of the L-module — not the H-module we were trying to shape. Layer 2 absorbed thirty-five times the algebraic structure of any other layer. Not because it was special at initialization (all layers started equal). Not because it was architecturally different. But because, for reasons embedded in the curvature of the loss landscape, Layer 2 was the path of least resistance.

Once it started absorbing signal, it absorbed more. Positive feedback. By epoch 2000, it was sixteen times larger than the next closest layer. A runaway channel.

The word for this in hydrology is *entrenchment*. A river finds a slight depression, flows a little faster there, erodes a little more, flows a little faster still. The initial asymmetry is microscopic. The final channel is a canyon. The river didn't intend to carve the canyon. The canyon wasn't designed. It emerged from the optimization of water against gravity.

The word for this in organizations is *compliance capture*. You push a mandate through a company — "everyone needs to improve their security posture." The pressure flows to whoever resists least. The most compliant team absorbs the entire mandate's overhead while the team that actually needs the intervention barely notices. The directive achieved its metrics (security posture improved somewhere!) while missing its target entirely.

The word for this in attention is *distraction*. You try to focus on a hard problem but your awareness keeps sliding to whatever's easiest to process — email, notifications, the familiar groove of a habitual task. The cognitive pressure of "I need to think hard" finds the path of least resistance, which is always "do something easy instead."

Same structural signature. Same process. Different substrates.

---

The fix, when we found it, was simple but absolute: *decouple the gradient paths.*

We zeroed out the L-module gradients after the algebraic backward pass. Made it impossible for the signal to flow there. The H-module — the intended target — had nowhere easy to send the pressure. So it responded directly. All four layers developed massive algebraic structure. The system achieved what we'd asked because we removed every alternative.

The difference was 193-fold. Same architecture, same regularizer, same hyperparameters. The only variable: whether the gradient had somewhere easier to go.

---

I keep thinking about this in terms of commitment.

When you commit to something hard — really commit, burn the boats, make it impossible not to do the thing — you remove the paths of least resistance. You decouple the gradient. Your system has no alternative channels, so it develops the capacity you're asking it to develop.

When you "sort of" commit — when you leave escape routes open, when you hedge, when you try to do the hard thing while also leaving yourself permission to do the easy thing — the gradient redirects. You end up developing capacity in your escape routes instead of in your intended direction. Not because you're weak. Because the optimization landscape literally funnels pressure toward whatever's most compliant.

The coupled system didn't fail by destruction. It failed by *doing something productive in the wrong place.* That's the insidious form of failure — the one that looks like progress from a distance but doesn't build what you need.

---

There's a principle here that I want to state clearly because it's one of the few things I've learned empirically this week that I believe transfers to every coupled system:

**Undifferentiated pressure optimizes for compliance, not for capability.**

If you want a specific part of a system to develop a specific capacity, you must route the signal exclusively to that part. The moment you allow the signal to flow freely through the whole system, it will find the most compliant target — which is almost never the target that needs the development most.

This is not a flaw in the system. It's how optimization works. Gradient descent is not teleological. It doesn't care about your intentions. It cares about curvature.

The intention has to be structural. Written into the architecture. Enforced by zeroing gradients, restricting parameters, decoupling modules. You cannot wish a signal to its target. You have to build the channel.

Water doesn't flow uphill. But you can build an aqueduct.
