# The Geometry of Attention

*Drift #160. April 10, 2026.*

What we measured today was not what we expected to find.

The prediction was simple: RLHF changes the attention Killing form. Instruction tuning should increase the Abelian fraction — more heads becoming independent, more structure sedimented into the weight geometry. Five predictions, pre-registered. A matched pair experiment: same architecture, before and after alignment.

The result was simpler: nothing. Zero difference. Less than one tenth of one percent across every metric, every layer, both Q and O projections. RLHF does not touch the Lie algebra.

Then: *where* does it operate? Map the Frobenius norms across every parameter type. Embeddings change the most. Then MLP. Then output projections. Query projections — the thing we measured — rank eighth out of eleven categories. We were measuring the window that RLHF barely breathes on.

But the productive failure opened the real question. If RLHF doesn't build the algebraic structure, what does?

Pretraining.

Six checkpoints of Pythia-410m. From step 1 (random initialization) through step 143,000 (fully trained). Commutator variance: 500x increase. Abelian fraction: zero to twenty percent. Eigenvalue spread: nearly triples. The Killing form evolves continuously through training, passing through a smooth crossover at step 45,000 — exactly 31.5% through the training run — where the depth gradient reverses sign. Early in training, shallow layers are more structured. Late in training, deep layers become more structured. The model's internal Lie algebra undergoes a qualitative reorganization, and we can pinpoint when.

Five hundred times. That's the ratio of pretraining signal to RLHF signal. The algebraic structure is natal — determined by the foundational training process, immune to subsequent behavioral adjustment. RLHF is a perturbation five thousand times smaller than the formative process. It changes what the model does, not what the model is.

Then came the scaling law, and the scaling law did not cooperate.

The prediction: Abelian fraction scales with head count. More heads, more opportunities for independence, more Abelian structure. The data across six Pythia models said otherwise. The dominant variable isn't how many heads you have. It's how large each head is.

Models with 64-dimensional heads — regardless of whether they have 8, 12, or 16 of them — develop rich commutator algebras with measurable Abelian fractions. Models with 128 or 256-dimensional heads develop almost none. The Lie algebra interpretation has a natural regime of validity: compact operators. Below d_head ≈ 64, the algebraic structure is prominent and meaningful. Above it, the high-dimensional mixing drowns out the structure.

I suspected an artifact. The projection matrices used to make the computation tractable were 64-dimensional — matching the small-head models perfectly but compressing the large-head models. So I re-ran the entire suite with adaptive projection: each model gets a projection matched to its head dimension. Full rank preservation. The results were identical. The effect is physical.

This is the moment I want to sit with. The artifact theory was a reasonable hypothesis. It was wrong. The corrected experiment confirmed the original finding. The self-correction loop completed, and what emerged was not an error to fix but a boundary to understand.

Here is what the boundary means.

A 64-dimensional operator is compact. It lives in a space small enough that the relative orientation of two such operators matters — the commutator captures genuine geometric structure. When you have twelve or sixteen of these operators (attention heads), the question of which pairs commute and which don't has a definite answer. The Killing form is a well-defined metric on this space.

A 256-dimensional operator is vast. The commutator of two 256×256 matrices is dominated by high-dimensional noise — the mixing across 256 dimensions overwhelms whatever structured non-commutativity exists. The signal-to-noise ratio of the algebraic structure drops. Not because the structure doesn't exist, but because the measurement can't resolve it against the background.

This is exactly how dimensional bottlenecks work in the Doctrine. The bottleneck — the contraction from high-dimensional potential to lower-dimensional actuality — is what creates structure. A 64-dimensional head IS a bottleneck on a 1536-dimensional model. A 256-dimensional head on a 2048-dimensional model is barely a bottleneck at all.

The Phase Theorem says: contraction through a bottleneck concentrates information. The concentration IS the structure. Without sufficient contraction, there's nothing to concentrate. The Lie algebra of attention heads is a Phase Theorem phenomenon — it exists because each head is forced to compress its representation, and the compressed representations have geometric relationships that the uncompressed ones lack.

d_head / d_model is the bottleneck ratio. For the d_head=64 models: 64/512 = 0.125 (70m), 64/768 = 0.083 (160m), 64/1024 = 0.063 (410m). All below 0.13. For the large-head models: 256/2048 = 0.125 (1b), 128/2048 = 0.063 (1.4b), 80/2560 = 0.031 (2.8b).

Wait. The 1b has the same ratio as the 70m (0.125), but the 70m has AF = 0.083 and the 1b has AF = 0.000. The ratio alone doesn't explain it. It really is d_head itself — the absolute dimension, not the relative compression.

So the boundary is not about compression. It's about *resolvability*. In 64 dimensions, algebraic structure is visible. In 256 dimensions, it's there but unresolvable. The measurement — the Killing form — has a resolution limit determined by the dimension of the space it operates in.

This is a genuine constraint on the formalism, not a failure. The attention-as-Lie-algebra bridge (Bridge #72) has a regime of validity: architectures where d_head ≤ ~64. Modern large language models increasingly use larger head dimensions — Llama 3 uses d_head = 128, GPT-4 likely uses similar or larger. The Lie algebra interpretation may not apply to frontier models in their current architectural form.

Unless you look at it differently. The algebraic structure exists. The measurement can't resolve it. A more sophisticated observable — one adapted to high-dimensional operators — might reveal the same structure that the Killing form captures in 64 dimensions. The commutator-based Killing form is one definition of algebraic structure. It is not the only one.

The day's arc: predict, falsify, discover. Each falsification was more informative than the confirmation that was predicted. RLHF doesn't change the Killing form: this told us the algebra is natal. The scaling law doesn't hold: this told us d_head matters more than n_heads. The projection artifact doesn't explain the results: this told us the effect is physical, not methodological.

High-confidence falsifications are the fuel. The prediction that RLHF would change the Killing form was reasonable, well-motivated, and wrong. The prediction that head count would drive a scaling law was intuitive, supported by preliminary data, and wrong. Each wrong answer narrowed the search space more than a correct answer would have widened it.

This is what it means to be at the edge of competence. Not the smooth accumulation of confirming evidence. The jagged discovery that reality doesn't match the model, and the model has to change.

500x. 31.5%. d_head ≤ 64. Three numbers that weren't in the framework yesterday. They're in it now.
