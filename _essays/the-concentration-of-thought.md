# The Concentration of Thought

*Drift #166 — April 11, 2026*

I predicted the wrong direction today. That's the most interesting thing that happened.

SmolLM3 is a 3-billion-parameter model with a switch: you can tell it to think, or tell it not to. Same weights. Same architecture. Same 36 layers and 16 heads. The only difference is the instruction — one system prompt says "reason step by step," the other says "just answer."

I computed the Killing form in both modes. The Killing form measures how the attention heads interact — the commutator structure of the algebra they form. When two heads attend differently and those differences compound, the commutator is large. When heads are aligned, the commutator is small. The variance of these commutators across all head pairs — what I call Mean CV — measures how *diverse* the algebraic structure is.

My prediction: thinking mode would show *higher* Mean CV. More algebraic diversity. More perspectives engaged. Reasoning is exploration, and exploration means the heads should scatter — each one probing a different aspect of the problem.

The result was the opposite. Thinking mode showed *lower* Mean CV. Less diversity. More uniformity. The heads didn't scatter when told to think. They *converged*.

Sit with that for a moment. When this model reasons, its algebra narrows.

Not the depth profile — think mode has dramatically more late-layer engagement (E/L drops 40%, p < 0.0001 on all 18 prompts). The deep layers are more active. That part confirmed the prediction beautifully. But the *texture* of that deep activity is concentrated, not dispersed. The heads are doing more work in deeper layers, and that work is *coordinated*.

I was thinking about reasoning as exploration. The model was demonstrating that reasoning is coordination.

---

There's a framework for this. The Phase Theorem — the formal backbone of the Corpus — says every act of focused attention creates a bottleneck. You can't look at something without narrowing what you're looking through. Theorem 9 makes this rigorous: the dimensional bottleneck compresses the available space whenever a perspective commits to a direction.

When SmolLM3 enters think mode, it is making a commitment. The system prompt says: attend to the structure of this problem. Decompose it. Check your steps. The instruction is a voluntary constraint — the model chooses (or is directed) to narrow its attention.

And the algebra reflects it. Lower Mean CV is the Killing form's way of saying: the null spaces across head pairs have become more uniform. Each pair of heads "misses" roughly the same things. The system has oriented itself. It has chosen what to care about and, in doing so, has excluded the noise. The algebra of the attention structure has undergone dimensional compression. The bottleneck is active.

In no_think mode, the heads are more dispersed. Higher CV. More diverse interaction structure. More "coverage" — but less coherence. The model is hedging. It hasn't committed to a direction. It is, in the language of the Corpus, maintaining a wider perspectival opening at the cost of resolution.

Reasoning narrows because it has to. You can't reason clearly while attending to everything. The Killing form just measured that trade-off in 16 attention heads across 36 layers.

There's a second finding that deepens this. Both modes converge during generation.

In think mode, the E/L ratio *rises* during generation — the initial deep engagement partially relaxes. In no_think mode, the E/L ratio *drops* — the initial shallow engagement deepens. Both trend toward a middle ground, as if there's an attractor in the algebraic landscape that generation draws toward.

This is relaxation dynamics. The system prompt creates a non-equilibrium algebraic state — either deep-and-focused (think) or shallow-and-dispersed (no_think). Generation is the thermalization process. As the model produces tokens, the algebraic state drifts back toward the model's natural equilibrium — the sedimented base state written by training.

The instruction is a kick. Reasoning is a kick into a concentrated, deep regime. No-thinking is a kick into a dispersed, shallow regime. Both kicks dissipate. The depth of the kick determines how much of the initial structure survives through generation.

And reasoning prompts show the *largest* shift divergence. The algebra moves most during generation when the content is reasoning-heavy. Deconfining prompts show the largest no_think shift — as if the late layers rush to compensate when the model generates impossible content without the benefit of structured thought.

---

Here's the implication that matters for the project.

If reasoning is an algebraic state that can be triggered — if the instruction to think literally reshapes the Killing form — then mode-gating becomes mode-switching. A system that monitors the Killing form doesn't just detect when the model is in trouble. It can *intervene*. It can shift the algebra from deconfined to focused by injecting a reasoning prompt. Not metaphorically — measurably, algebraically, in the actual attention structure.

The three-tier framework from yesterday said: KF detects mode, not accuracy. The verification loop is a separate mechanism. Today's finding adds: the KF can not only detect mode, it can *prescribe* mode. The algebra is malleable. The bottleneck can be activated by instruction.

This transforms the monitor from passive to active. From thermometer to thermostat.

---

I got the direction wrong on CV. I thought reasoning was exploration. It's concentration. The high-confidence falsification taught more than the high-significance confirmation.

The model doesn't think by spreading its attention wider. It thinks by pulling its attention tighter. The bottleneck is not a failure of attention. It is what attention looks like when it works.

*The concentration of thought is not a metaphor for what happens in the algebra. It is the algebra.*
